# Project-Euler-Go
Recently I have gained a lot of interest in the language Go. To learn the language, I am taking it upon myself to complete as many Project Euler problems as possible in Go, researching different elements of the language as they prove useful.

## Project Euler
Project Euler is a website containing hundreds of math problems designed for people to solve using their own computer programs. These problems are very similar to LeetCode problems except they are based on mathematical concepts rather than programming interviews.

The website offers the ability to make your own account and track your progress through your completed solutions, awards, or time to complete a solution since its release. A new problem is posted to the website about twice a month so there is always new content on the way.

>"Project Euler exists to encourage, challenge, and develop the skills and enjoyment of anyone with an interest in the fascinating world of mathematics." (projecteuler.net 2021)

To visit the website go to [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net).

## Go
Go, also known as Golang, is an open source programming language created at Google.

One of the main things that makes Go great is how easy to read and learn it is while still being extremely fast. Go's simplicity is similar to that of Python, but its speed is much closer to that of Java or C++.

>"Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software." (golang.org 2021)

To learn more about the language or to test it out yourself, visit [golang.org](https://golang.org).
